## Technologies Used
This project is created with:
* Python 3.8.2
* PyTorch 1.8.1
* OpenVINO 2020.4.287
* OpenCV 4.3

## Hardware Used
* A typical desktop computer was used to train and convert the mask detection model classifiers.
* A Raspberry Pi 4 with an RPi Camera was used for the development and deployment of the real time detection system.
* A Intel NCS2 connected to the RPi 4 was used to run inference of the mask detection and face detection models.
